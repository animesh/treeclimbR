Description: The arrangement of hypotheses in a hierarchical structure appears 
    in many research fields and often indicates different resolutions at which 
    data can be viewed. On which resolution level should the signal be 
    intepreted has arisen researchers' interest. A flexible method to select 
    resolution level, instead of cutting the tree structure at arbitary levels,
    is desired. Our package treeAGG, which uses minP algorithm, is a such tool. 
    It does a bottom-up search for the optimal level of a tree to interpret 
    signal by combining with current available tools, such as edgeR or DESeq2.
