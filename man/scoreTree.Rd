\title{Generate score accounting for the family effect}
\usage{
scoreTree(tree, score_data, node_column, score_column, new_score)
}
\arguments{
\item{tree}{A phylo object}

\item{score_data}{A data frame that includes at least two columns. One column
stores the number of the node, and the other stores the original score of
the corresponding node.}

\item{node_column}{The name of the column that stores the number of the node.}

\item{score_column}{The name of the column that stores the original score of the
node.}

\item{new_score}{The name of the column to store the new generated score.}
}
\description{
\code{scoreTree} takes the tree structure into account when calculating the
score for an internal node. If an internal node A has two children B and C,
\code{(A->B, A->C)}, the new score at node A would be calculated as the mean
(sum or other user-specified function) of the whole family (A, B and C). The
generation starts from the leaves and the new generated scores are used to
update those in higher level of the tree until the root is reached.
